Ideas
Decrease range of melee cav compared to infantry counterpart, seems like it would be a little harder to maneuver a long spear on a horse.
Melee Champs + .25/5 range? heroes?
Archer/slinger/Jav same run/walk speed?
Han - watchtower cart
Han - currency, coins?

tried to bring back 10% health for all units when u hit p2, but having issues with that at moment...

If there is a enough interests, I would like to start tweaking other civs as well to try and make them more historically accurate, unique yet still balanced.  What Ive noticed so far while testing out sparta is they are weak/challenging to play late game...
