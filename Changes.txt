tried to bring back 10% health for all units when u hit p2, but having issues with that at moment...

If there is a enough interests, I would like to start tweaking other civs as well to try and make them more historically accurate, unique yet still balanced.  What Ive noticed so far while testing out sparta is they are weak/challenging to play late game...
