BUILDING CONTROL
Building arrows can be controlled independently of the rally point:
Right-clicking on an enemy sets both the rally point and building arrows to that enemy (Right).
Use ctrl to only set the rally point on an enemy (middle)
Use "Focus Fire", which is unbound by default, to only target the building arrows on an enemy (left).
